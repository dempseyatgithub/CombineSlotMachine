CombineSlotMachine Read Me
=================================

This project demonstrates some uses of the Combine framework introduced with Xcode 11 by building a rudimentary iOS slot machine game.

This example is intended to show using the Combine framework with a traditional UIKit app and so it does not use SwiftUI.

It requires Xcode 11 and the Combine framework. It is based on Xcode 11 beta 2, which introduces Combine support to the Foundation framework.

This example demonstrates the following:

- Publishing properties with the @Published attribute
- Combining publishers using the Zip3 publisher
- Map operation
- Assign operation
- Standard library random methods

### TUTORIAL.md file ###

The intent for this project is to tag a commit that represents a step along the way to building the project.

The TUTORIAL.md file contains the name of the tag and some explanation of that step. The most recent step is the top of the file, so you don't need to scroll to the end of the document to see the information about the most recent step.

It's a little experiment I'm trying, we'll see how it goes!
